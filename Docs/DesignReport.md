 O | X | O

### Coding Method

#### Test Driven Development(TDD)

##### In this project the team used Test Driven Development. TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: 
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails
3. Write the code
4. Run tests
5. Refactor code
6. Repeat

##### When the code is successful you can commit the code.

#### Markdown syntax & pair programming

The team used markdown syntax in the documentation. The documentation reports are three and all stored in a folder called docs in the root of the repository. The team also used the agile software development technique pair programming in some cases. Pair programming was an efficient way to solve some problems that came up.

### Other

While the team was getting used to the GitHub environment it was decided to use an old repository to practice. Some of the team members had never used GitHub. With this method we made sure that no unnecessary files were in the repository that was shared with hap2000.
